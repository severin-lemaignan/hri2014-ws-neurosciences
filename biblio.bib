  abstract = {People excel at attributing intentionality to other agents, whether
	in simple scenarios such as shapes moving in two dimensions or complex
	scenarios such as people interacting. We note that intentionality
	attributions seem to fall into two categories: low-level intentionality
	in which an observer has a theory of mind about an agent, and high-level
	intentionality in which an observer believes the agent has a theory
	of mind about something else. We introduce the terms L-intentionality
	and H-intentionality to refer to these attributions, respectively,
	and describe this division by using examples from previous research.
	Social robots provide a particularly good platform for evaluating
	the presence of different types of intentionality, and we discuss
	how robots can help distinguish the relationship between H- and L-intentionality,
	based on a number of possible models that we enumerate. We conclude
	by highlighting some interesting questions about intentionality in
	general and the interplay between H- and L-intentionality in particular.}

	crucial logical properties of mental state expressions in language.
	This isomorphism points to a common underlying form of internal representation

	compute the complex function postulated to underlie pretend play.
	This model also reveals pretense as an early manifestation of the

	However, insights into this topic are an important prerequisite when
	discussing, for example, ethical issues regarding the question of
	what role we (want to) allow robots to play in our lives. In line
	with the Media Equation, humans may react towards robots as they
	do towards humans, making it all the more important to carefully
	investigate the preconditions and consequences of contact with robots.
	Based on assumptions on the socialness of reactions towards robots
	and anecdotal evidence of emotional attachments to robots (e.g. Klamer
	and {BenAllouch} in Trappl R. (ed.), Proceedings of {EMCSR} 2010,
	Vienna, 2010; Klamer and {BenAllouch} in Proceedings of the 27th

	further insights into the question of whether humans show emotional
	reactions towards Ugobe’s Pleo, which is shown in different situations.
	We used a 2×2 design with one between-subjects factor “prior interaction
	with the robot” (never seen the robot before vs. 10-minute interaction
	with the robot) and a within-subject factor “type of video” (friendly
	interaction video vs. torture video). Following a multi-method approach,
	we assessed participants’ physiological arousal and self-reported
	emotions as well as their general evaluation of the videos and the
	robot. In line with our hypotheses, participants showed increased
	physiological arousal during the reception of the torture video as
	compared to the normal video. They also reported fewer positive and
	more negative feelings after the torture video and expressed empathic
	concern for the robot. It appears that the acquaintance with the
	robot does not play a role, as “prior interaction with the robot”
	showed no effect.},
